# Pitchfork Data Analysis

## What does this project contain?
This project primarily uses data obtained from [components.one](https://components.one/datasets/pitchfork-reviews-dataset). The data itself is a web scrape of all album reviews on Pitchfork.com between the dates of January 5, 1999 and January 11, 2019. This project also uses data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019) on the Recording Instustry Association of America (RIAA) album sales.
